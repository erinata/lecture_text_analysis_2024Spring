"Kris is incredible! I would get breakouts on my face and I had these small bumps all over my face that I just couldn't get rid of. I had tried everything! I tried so many products and I had even seen other aestheticians but I still wasn't happy with my skin. \n\nI saw the reviews here so I decided to go see Kris and she knew exactly what my skin needed. After a couple of months of using her products and getting facials, my skin was so clear! I even started getting random compliments on how good my skin looked. \n\nI went to Spain for six months and I was worried about how my skin would do without facials, but I took the products that I got from Kris with me and it kept my skin clear the whole time. Now that I'm back, I still go get facials to keep my skin extra glowey. I highly recommend coming here if your skin needs some love."
"Terrible experience!!!!!!!!!!! I hired them to pack my four bedroom home the day before the moving trucks were to arrive to move me. When I arrived home in the evening to inspect the packing I found less then half the house packed. I took photos and sent them to head office asking for a refund and an explanation. I was up until 3 am packing my house and I am now still waiting a month to hear from them regarding what they will do for me. They took the payment on my visa and I have had no refund for a job NOT DONE!! Terrible company shame on them! *the franchise owner is also an owner of 1-800-GOT-JUNK."
"A hidden gem in a very quiet plaza. The good food, service and potion size warrants a solid 4 stars. I would definitely come back again to try more dishes. \n\nFood:\nOrdered the khinkali (georgian dumplings) with pork and beef which were large dumplings with juicy well seasoned fillings. The dumpling skin was thin with a generous sized filling that gave it a nice texture. Perfect appetizer to start. \n\nCrepes sulliko was a great choice as well. I liked it plain without the sauce so that I could fully appreciate the ground beef filling. Crepes was wrapped like a large spring roll. \n\nLamb shish kabob was delicious. The mashed potato side dish complimented it well. The creamy mash paired with the very meaty lamb kabob was a great combo. I ordered medium for kabob and it came to perfection. Tender and delicious. Don't get fooled that it's 1 kabob, portions are generous. The naan that came with it was fluffy and soft. \n\nService:\nAlthough busy, the food came out quickly and they were attentive. However, I would have liked it more if they would provide refills of water, sauce and sharp knives with the kabobs without us asking all the time."
"I have worked with Jesse and all the guys at Creative for YEARS helping my clients relocate... and just had the pleasure of hiring them to move me and my family. They are ALL courteous and friendly and always efficient. Hire them, you will NOT be disappointed."
"Best hookah in town! The music is really good and service is on point! The owner is so cool, a lot of places won't pay attention to you or the hookah and let it get super harsh and we always had a smooth experience (: mike is the best hookah man around. And so handsome haha! Thank you for the experience!"
"Worst service! Arrived two minutes till five and unless I had everything printed and labeled they would not assist me to ship it because they were closing in two minutes. \n\nAll that is wrong with our government summarized in a single employee."
"Worst ever!!! They are slow and there's no kiosk or even a stamp machine.  They are near a college university and tons of business, so you'd think they'd be better equipped.  I've never had a good experience here and do not intend to go back.  I will drive out of my way to go to a different post office!"
"There's an earlier review that says this place is not for amateurs, and I disagree. The employees are incredibly willing to help you find something in your price range, and their guidance is never pretentious or pushy - just passionate and friendly. You can find bottles as low as $12. There are tastings on Saturday with the $10 fee waived with purchase. Highly recommend!!"
"I think I won't return anymore.\n\nThe food was not very tasty.  The omurice was so so, deep fried combo was ok and the pancake was not good at all.\n\nI think j town fast food green tea cafe was so much better."
"So glad we stopped at Londa's\nThey had a wide variety of choices and everything was great. The Green's and Mac & cheese were great and the Ox Tail. Some in my group had fried chicken and\nBeef ribs. Everyone cleaned their plates. \n\nYou can tell the owner works her business. Customer service was great, unlike a lot of places now. \n\nHappy 1 year Anniversary Londa!  Hoping the community supports you and you have many more."
"They have an amazing atmosphere.  It always smells delicious as you walk in. It is super clean, staff seems nice but a little eager to get you to order. It's a decent menu with a variety of goods. My second time here I had watermelon last time.. I choose nachos this time. There is a an inviting water fountain with orange slices as a welcome gesture. I can see myself returning. PS. I'm a very picky customer and they have satisfied my expectations."
"Went in tonight, place is still busy, samosas are hot and fresh. We got some sweets tonight, mix of burfis with pistachios, chocolate and almonds; perra and gulab jamun. $4.00 for 10 nice pcs!"
"This is not news.  This is someones idea of what they want you to think.  They report only one side of an issue and us language that prevents people from learning the truth about issues.  They withhold information as well.  I can't and won't watch the news any longer.  The internet has far better sources to learn what is really going on.  Turn off your TVs.  They are making you stupid."
"This place has great all you can eat sushi.  Can't really beat the price around Pittsburgh."
"Oh my goodness so worth it! 90 mins.  Feel like a new person.  Hot stone.  Beautiful Thai massage.  Highly recommend."
"Horrible experience waiting for HOURS with my eight year old daughter who needed stitches in her head. Horribly rude and very unhelpful staff made for a terrible night in the ER."
"I was hopeful my mediocre experience 2 years ago would be improved, but it got worse.  I found an ad for a vehicle at CBB on autotrader and went to the CBB website and found the same vehicle advertised. I clicked the schedule a test drive link and specified a time I would like to come see the vehicle and test drive. I received a quick email response and then a text message from a sales rep. He stated he could accommodate my time. I clarified my need for the specific time he agreed. When I arrived he was out on another test drive. Another sales person offered to help. He confirmed the vehicle on his computer and told me he would pull it around.  After nearly 10 minutes he returned and stated he could not find the car.  The original salesperson I scheduled the appointment with came and stated the car I wanted to test drive had not arrived at the dealership yet. \n\nVery frustrating and a waste of time!"
"This gym is dirty and cannot be safe. They are always out of sanitizer, paper towels etc... The pool and the saunas looks like it's never been cleaned. I pretty sure mold is growing. In a stall in the dressing room there has been a swim liner stuck on wall for 3 yrs. why do I have a membership. I keep hoping 1 day they'll clean it. No cleans the equipment. I'm surprise no has caught anything from this gym. It's disgusting. I'm calling the health board."
"Happy to travel from Aliante area to finally get authentic Italian Gelato! I had the salted caramel and my husband had the stracciatella ~ both delicious. Added a cuppa cappuccino as well, and tasted just as the ones we drink in Europe..not starbuckery. Beautiful wide open seating area, very clean and the staff are friendly and accommodating- have a chat with them, you won't be disappointed. Making this our Go To Gelato place..and cannot wait to try their other menu options. BTW They serve Milkbone gelato for your furry friends!"
"My husband and I joined this gym specifically because of geographic location as it's near to our house.  My expectations were low, but the price is affordable, lots of handweights, bathrooms are clean and stocked, the people are nice, the gym is relatively quiet (which I like) and I never feel like I have to compete for equipment.  \n\nThis is a great non-meathead gym, perfect for those who prefer not to talk to anyone.  \n\nWould love to see a few more machines (Hip Abduction), but overall very pleased!  I'm grateful to have it so close by."
"This place is the real deal! My wife and I went and redeemed our one free samosa with a good old fashioned Yelp check-in, which was really good, and we shared some chicken tikka masala- shizz was de-lish! It was plenty of food for the both of us, and it came with rice. We got some garlic naan on the side which completed a full revolution of an Indian foodgasm. \n\nThe people there were super nice, and Muhammad is the man and will take good care of you. The only thing they were missing was some background music. I was hesitant to even talk much because the whole restaurant would have been a part of my convo, but music would easily change that. \n\nNext time I go I'm definitely gonna branch out and try the Afghani stuff!"
"This place easily gets 5 out of 5 stars. Great atmosphere and amazing service! I've been here 2 times now and each time the servers have been amazing. The breakfast bruschetta is an amazing way to start your meal and literally ANYTHING on the menu makes for a great main course. Great coffee, mimosas, and a spectacular Bloody Mary bar as well. This needs to be the next place you get brunch. A++++"
"My first time here tonight and we got seated immediately at a booth for 5. Our server was Gregorio and he was very nice and on top of things. The wait for the food was not very long, around 15-20 minutes after they took our order. I had 3 tacos al pastor and they were very good, although they are not like the usual street tacos with the pineapple. It was one of our family members' birthday and they sang for him and gave him a tequila shot, which was very funny. Overall, the restaurant gave off an ambience that felt very authentic and it did not feel like we were in Vegas still. The service was on point and I would definitely come back!"
"After attending a few games at Salt River Field and Scottsdale Municipal I was very impressed with the Surprise Stadium. It had a very small, intimate spring training feel. The layout and style is very cool. There is shade if you sit in the lower box closer to the infield.\n\nWorth checking out if your team is playing out here... the downside is its FAR away from central Phoenix and Scottsdale. Also, the concessions areas are packed and not much room."
"My favorite sushi place in Las Vegas! The sushi is served in perfect proportions. Sometimes the service is mediocre, but the quality of the food never disappoints."
"Shane's rib shack is very good quality with their wings and all other foods. Definitely enjoy coming here with friends and families. Staff is always polite and Shane's will never have you waiting hours for your food. 10\/10"
"I'm a pretty picky hair person considering I don't have amazing hair. Lauren is amazing and the salon is well-run. It's comfortable, stylish and the staff all knows how to do great hair. I love coming here. The customer service is amazing. They know my name when I walk in. The lather lounge with hand massage (which is complimentary) is amazing. I highly recommend this salon over all of the other she-she salons in Scottsdale that are all fluff and no outcome."
"Favorite place to go.  Food variety is perfect, affordable pricing, always seated within 10 minutes, great service, and LOVE the food.  Best butter cake I have ever had anywhere."
"One of the best meals in Las Vegas.y brother and I ordered the Forbes menu. I know what you're thinking! Crazy expensive!! But you only life once and you can't take it with you! Plus sharing this experience with loved ones is priceless. \n\nDungeness crab, Osetra Caviar with spring vegetables \n\nTurbot roasted on the bone, baby artichoke Barigoule natural Jus \n\nArtichoke and Black Truffle soup \nToasted Mushroom Brioche and\nBlack Truffle butter \n\nSealand A5 Japanese Wagyu Beef, Lobster \nAsparagus and Morels \n\nThe 5 Stars of Chocolate \n\nLet me tell you something. I loved the house made bread. Especially the rosemary focaccia. Let me say that again. Especially the rosemary Focaccia! \n\nI never had roasted Turbot before and the shellfish Jus that they used In this dish was exceptional. The single most amazing fish dish I've ever had before\nIn my life. \nI was most excited about A5 Wagyu and morels. They didn't list the corn ravioli that was amazing. Explosive in flavor in a good Way!! \n\nI will day the food was amazing, but the service was exemplary!. I wish I could remember their names, but I guess I'll have to eat here again."
"I was shocked and truly hurt today by Earnhardt Chrysler. I pulled up to look at used cars today. I asked where to park and the salesperson pointed to a handicap spot, then he went on to demonstrate how I should get out of my car. He demonstrated by walking around with a fake limp and used very hurtful facial expressions as if he was a handicap person. Then when I mentioned this  to a lot manager he told he couldn't control all  of his employees. To make matters worse when  leaving the sales person ran up to me and said the manager told me to tell you sorry. Why I'm posting this is because I'm the farther of a special needs child. If anyone has a similar family situation as me, or knows anybody who does please remember this before buying a car from the Earnhardt Group. They say they work with the community, but today they didn't show it. I hope everyone i came into contact today at Earnhardt has moment in their lives to walk in my shoes."
"We both got AYCE dinner. Good price for the quality of food. Very attentive service. Great rice to fish ratio. Awesome selection of nigiri and appetizers."
"The worst steak house. The food is at the best mediocre. People fall for false advertisement. Seriously you can find a lot of good quality aged steak elsewhere. The meat was cold in the middle. I had to send it back. Then they over cooked the same meat and brought it back. I wouldn't waste my money in the place. Try  Gordon Ramsay Steak. 100 times better. Don't fall for the advertisement."
"I have tried a lot of Mexican restaurants in the area and found this one to be one of the best. I had the beef fajitas and they were excellent. The service was very good."
"It's a great mall in a old tradition of the West of uncovered malls. The town square has a variety of high-end stores almost any that you could want for really any age group.  It also has a local ambiance rather than a tourist Ambiance so it's a safe place to go to escape people who might have had too much to drink on the strip and it's also safe place to go if you're a single Traveler. There are some great choices for food that anyone would enjoy from single people to families. There's also a movie theater. Parking is easy as well as a drop off from a hotel shuttle."
"Took in a package we needed to over night from FEDEX.  \n\nThe gal filled out the mailing label and printed it, and asked us to confirm it was correct, the address was correct, but she spelled the  name wrong.  When I said oh the name is wrong, you would have thought I slapped her or something, she GOT NASTY!  Don't use rudeness to cover up your mistakes, pretty soon people are going to realize that your service is really bad lady! \n\nFirst we got a nasty snear,, \n\nTHEN we were threatened (if I have to redo it, you will miss the fex ex guy) I didn't see him anywhere on the premises and she just took our package over and put it in a box.  \nWe paid $50 to over night it, it better be there on time.  \n\nThen we were worried because of her attitude our package wasn't going out today, thanks but from now on I'll go to the UPS store. \n\nBTW there was  doctor in there trying to get a document notarized and the old man in there gave the guy the 3rd degree and was pretty nasty to him, so I guess those services are out here too.  \n\nMaybe he needs a refresher..... https:\/\/www.asnnotary.org\/?form=basicduties\n\nIf you don't like working with the public, maybe you shouldn't be working with or in front of the public."
"Had Ryan come out for a simple fix.  While he was here, he gave me a quote on a new hot water heater.  (Original came with the condo and turned out to be 16 years old!)  A few weeks passed, and he reached out to see if i had made a decision about replacing the old unit.  I did some price shopping, and found Pipetech's prices to be competitive with the big box stores.  (Plus, installation, taxes, and haul away were included in the price!)  Called to make an appointment, and had the new heater installed the very next day.  No upcharge, no surprises, no problems.  Nice to finally have a plumber I can trust."
"Can't wait to leave this place. How does this make sense? Stopped by to give our mandatory 60 day notice to move and they said that our lease will be up on the 31st of May and have to be out by 31 May, yet we have a prorated one day June 1st that we are responsible for?! How does that even make sense? They always want to squeeze every last dime out of you no matter what the situation. If I am paying an extra day then I am staying until midnight on June 1st! We have had so many problems with this place. Noisy neighbors running up and down the corridors, maintenance people that don't know what they are doing.  Trash overflowing. For $1200 a month for an apartment this should be an awesome place yet it's not. Like everything should look pristine and everything should be amazing. It's not. Save your money and your frustration and look elsewhere."
"Rude staff, sleazy policies. Charged me double the cover of what the promoter told me and the open bar promised for my girlfriend ended up costing $30 dollars for a terrible drink. Apparently the bar they told us was the open bar (the one immediately to the left) was not the open bar, which they told her after pouring the drink and charging her. Definitely would not recommend this place.\n\nI've never written a yelp review but this was such a terrible experience it inspired me to post about it."
"The atmosphere is so nice in this restaurant. We received our food and my order was incorrect (no big deal, it happens), waitress brought back the wrong order again, finally got the right food on the 3rd time. The food seemed to have no seasoning on it. The portions were tiny considering the price. This was my first and last time returning."
"By far THE BEST Walgreens I have ever gone to.  I've had the luxury of flying into Vegas the last two trips that I've taken.  This is great because I'm not spending hours in the car but it also sucks because I cannot bring more than 3 oz. of liquids on my flight unless I want to check my bags (that's a negative).\n\nCut to buying booze at this Walgreens.  It is a convenient walk from the Cosmopolitan where I stayed on the first trip.  We just took that bridge from the Cosmo to Walgreens for alcohol, Powerade, chasers, Pepto Bismol, candy, snacks, popcorn.  You name it, we bought it at this Walgreens.\n\nCut to the second trip in Vegas: we stayed at the Marriott Grand Chateau - also walking distance.  We pretty much did the same alcohol run.  However, on this trip, I did a haphazard job at packing and forgot my eyeliner.  No problemo.  This Walgreens has the BEST cosmetics section ever.  My friends hovered around the fragrance section and even ended purchasing the one named Between the Sheets (made for an interesting talking point with cab drivers).  I picked up a great liquid eyeliner which has now replaced the Sephora one I was using before.\n\nThe line to check out looks really intimidating but here's a secret - you can check out that the register in the cosmetics area!  \n\nFrom here on out, I will be planning Vegas trips and where we stay in Vegas based on its proximity to this Walgreens.  Legit."
"Parking is available in front but can be busy so there is extra parking in the parking structure or behind the venue in the dirt lot. We've been here once and I will say that the food was amazing. We had the Galbi short ribs and the tuna chips. Both were absolutely delicious with great presentation. Austin was our server and bar tender. He is the bar manager and was awesome with drink explanation and food information. The food came out quick and hot. The bill for 2 pina colladas, large Kirin beer, 3 plates to share was 49.00 which we felt was very reasonable. Happy hour is from open until 6pm everyday!! Best happy hour in the area! Great music in the background, easy seating, and friendly staff. Come down for an amazing time!!!!\n\nWe came at 1pm on a Tuesday so don't let the photos deter you. Austin says Thursday thru Sat are haopi!!"
"Great sandwiches!!!  Service is great too, but I do wish they had french fries to make it 5 stars."
"Traveled from Boston to Las Vegas for World Series.  With the help of Yelp reviews, we discovered Arawan.  What a great place!  The food was the best Thai food we  have had.  Great service.  Thai pancake for dessert was out of this world.  What a great night out.  Admittedly it is located in a run down strip mall but get over it and get inside.  Friendly and attentive servers."
"New game in town! Love that I don't have to travel all the day to Parkdale to get some authentic momos! A cool addition to Greektown. \n\nDelicious momos. Loved the flavours. Lamb was my fave! I also love that the momos come with salad and soup. \n\nVery kid friendly! Has high chairs and plastic utensils for kids!\n\nVery reasonably priced. Owners are so friendly. Will definitely come back and try their noodles."
"This is the worst pizza and other food restaurant I have ever been to. Gross greasy wings, thick and uncooked pizza dough, and all of the workers are miserable..I do NOT recommend!"
"This is a hidden gem in old town Scottsdale.  The ambiance is super cute. I had the avocado toast and loved it!. Would love to have a luncsoon outside when the weather gets better."
"This young, professional lady just moved her lash lounge into our building. Aside from being super friendly, she turned out to do some amazing work as i sent her 3 of my friends (with the special deals that she has going on) and they all loveddd the work and pricing; simply bringing back more of their friends was a sign and enough to prove that. I had to write something here because many entrepreneurs look at clients as time slots and ... The personal level of attention and flexibility, not mention best prices for an experienced and professional technician (as my gfs tell me) come about rarely in any industry, so when its found i feel obliged to give the credit where its due! \nTry her for sure ladies.. You'll love itt, well.. My friends did.."
"Unpretentious yet fundamentally sound, they offer all the favorites one expects to find in a Greek neighborhood eatery. I've eaten everything on the menu and it has been wonderful each time. Prices are fair and service is always ingratiating and with a smile. It is small and subdued and they have always greeted me warmly. A hundred times more preferable to run of the mill fast food. Give them a try."
"Cute little hidden shop. You can grab coffee and shop away. The place is a bit small but I've never gone and felt crowded. The worker was very friendly and helped me pick out the perfect gift for my husband and even took the time to help me discover some new local brands."
"Azul Landscape & Design was by far the best experience I had with a landscaping company! Anthony was very easy to work with, he listened to what we wanted and now our backyard looks amazing! Everything was done in a timely matter and high quality workmanship. Thank you for the great experience! I highly recommend Azul Landscape & Design!"
"We bought the Groupon and it went great! Taylor was super helpful and nice about showing us how to get our first spray tan. Also the salon is super cute and clean. Great experience and we will definitely use again!"
"My hair is naturally curly, I come from NY where it's easy to find someone to do your hair but in LV I have had my share of disappointments. With that said it's been really hard to find a hairstylist who can understand curly hair and not be scared of it. I found this salon through yelp reviews and read amazing reviews on Amber, I finally decided to go after my hair stylist had an accident and I havnt gone back in 2 months and each time she surprises me on how well she does it. It doesn't take long and what ever I have asked for she's delivered, very happy and excited to find Amber."
"We had a terrible experience at this bar last night. My friends who are from ages 22-26, all well above 21, were denied drinks from the bartender after the bouncer approved the IDS. My friends were told that their IDs were fake when they were most definitely not. Furthermore, when we went to the bathroom in the back, upon coming out, we were accused by the guard of sneaking through the side door, when he very well saw us enter the bathroom beforehand. We ordered 2 beers and were charged for 6. The place is dirty, plays lousy music, and has a terrible staff."
"So Mac's can be tricky for an old-schooler. Walked in and met Chris. I explained my MacPro wouldn't update as best I could with my limited vocabulary, and he assured that he could fix it. In a flash, Chris gave me a call and the work was done. If you need help with your Mac MacBook or MacPro, these guys are the pros you need. I highly recommend them as Chris listened patiently to my description and was calm and friendly during every communication. These guys rock!"
"Well I  have been to the blue point during happy hour and it was amazing! BUT have I do say,  BUT the reason why I went back about 2 months later and it was VERY disappointing. For starters, The drink I ordered before the martini was so so and not to the top at all and if you took the olives out it would be half full, ....the Lobster Risotto was fantastic the first time. This time is was mushy very seafood smelly, (stinky) not creamy and watery. One of the worst I've ever had,  .... DISAPPOINTED!\n \nThe Shrimp was Great nothing bad to say here all Great.\n\nThe Black shell MUSSELS were tiny tiny tiny.. bring your reading glasses to see these, among being very sandy or stony just about every one..\n\nMake sure you bring a 10 spot for valet.... not cheap at all.\nSO SO very disappointed on the return visit..."
"My husband and I used Quest from Calgary airport to Lake Louise and back.  Our driver was at the airport when we arrived even though I had given them the wrong flight number. Our driver was very friendly and courteous and the vehicle was clean and warmed up for us.  Also, I checked a few other car services and Quest had the best rates. We hope to return next year and will definitely use Quest again."
"We had great experience with quest limos this weekend, we used their services this evening, vehicles was exact as it was in pictures. \ndriver was on time and very knowledgeable about downtown clubs as we have to make few stops. i will definitely use them again."
"The best school for dealer training around. Professional instructors and great environment to learn at your own pace.  In a few hours a day I was able to learn 3 games blackjack roulette and dice.  They also help with job placement  I was able to get a job dealing dice within a month and a half. I highly recommend this school for anyone looking to get in the casino business.  Thanks again Jesse."
"The food was very good. We enjoyed it. We didn't order as much food as we normally do and we were full...even had leftovers to take with us. \nI gave it 4 stars because of the service. They didn't fill our water and I felt we were being rushed. They close at 11:30pm and we got there at 10:30pm. As we were leaving, the gentleman asked if we enjoyed our food and then said just in time we're closed. Something like that.... I just felt rushed..."
"The worst delivery experience. I've eaten at this place numerous times and I've been a loyal customer til this point.\n\n A friend and I ordered sushi from this restaurant last night. The delivery man got lost and after calling back and forth he still couldn't find our location. I decided to call the restaurant, to inform them of what was happening. A few minutes later, I get a call from the delivery man, YELLING at me for calling his boss and decided that he wouldn't be bringing our food. \n\nWe've been waiting for our sushi for about an hour now, just to be told we'd have to wait another hour for our order. The manager was telling us the delivery man couldn't find our location (like that wasn't already known). But seriously, in a time of Google maps, GPS and your job description having to do with finding people's houses, it's hard to take that excuse seriously. Especially when I literally live 7 minutes away walking.\n\nThe order was prepaid  on Just-Eat, so I'm still waiting on a refund. There was no apology, no prompt responses, and NO FOOD. Majority of the time when we called, a waitress with a heavy accent would pick up, just to tell us she didn't understand what we were saying. \n\nI used to love this restaurant but I'm boycotting it from now on. Just terrible customer service."
"Came to Egg  and I For first time. The service provided by Chance was great ! She made wonderful reccomendations and the food was out of this world."
"Edgar did a great job for me - I really smashed my iPhone 6 screen. I was quoted up to $200 to get it fixed in Fort McMurray. Edgar charged me less than half of that."
"Peut être que le patron n'est pas le plus social ou souriant, mais c'est les dumplings que tu manges, on s'en *%&6$!+, si t'aimes pas ses dumplings, tu les as probablement mal préparés, parce qu'ils sont absolument exquis, même bien meilleurs que beaucoup de places au Quartier Chinois que j'ai fait ! A1 à essayer, même si le patron ne vous lèchera pas les bottes comme beaucoup en restauration pour avoir leur tip ;p"
"The Cabeza is amazing! I had the vampiros (tostadas) they were so good and crisp. The carne asada was also very flavorful!"
"red tiger looks like a run of the mill pub on the outside but the food and cocktails were so much more. the dishes are served tapas style and in a large group (30 people) we had the opportunity to try most things on the menu - the wings and chicken skewers were a favorite. they also had a variety of tropical drinks and beers on tap. the music and vibe were also great - will be back!"
"A friend had heard amazing things about Hogtown Smoke and I had never really been to a real smokehouse before so we decided to check it out. I heard one of the big reasons to go to this place is so you can hang out on the patio. Sadly I go deaf when there is a lot of traffic outside. This restaurant is in The Beaches so we decided to stay inside where it was definitely very, very quiet.\n\nThe menu was very well organized but there was a little problem... The prices were a tad high! I know the food is cooked longer which must be more expensive but this made me have pretty high expectations for the quality of food. In other words, it had better taste as good as they are charging. \n\nThe fried pickles were pretty good. I liked that they were deep fried in a cornmeal crust. It gave them some additional crunch and bite. The dipping sauce was also quite good. Then our meat meal came. Chicken wings and burnt butts, apparently their specialty. Everyone loves them. \n\nThe restaurant had its own plethora of BBQ sauces to choose from for the wings. I did not like any of them. The odds of that are very low. I always need a sauce. I kept trying and trying but they all tasted kind of... funky.\n\nSpeaking of which, those burnt butts were all kinds of wrong. Just because you cook something for a long time does not make it more delicious. I have no issues with slightly carcinogenic blackened meat but this was pretty awful. Dry, off tasting, off putting... And not cheap!\n\nI could live with the not-greatness of the meal but the worst part was using the washroom down the break-neck-steep staircase in the basement. Hygienically, it is the worst washroom I have ever been to at a restaurant. It stank like a hogtown (maybe THAT is where it gets its name) and the sink did not work. It made me sick to my stomach and I wanted to get the hell out of there.\n\nI will say that the service was very pleasant and we were not rushed out of there at all. Considering the lack of people in the restaurant though... The only reason why I am giving this restaurant any wooden spoon is because of the service and the deep fried pickles. The people were nice but I am sorry, for that price the quality and flavour of the food were terrible and the pigsty in the basement unforgivable. I will not be back and have actually warned family and friends to stay away.\n\nI give this foodie experience one of out five wooden spoons. Dine there with caution and bring hand sanitizer! ~ Suzie the Foodie\n\nRead full review here: http:\/\/www.suziethefoodie.com\/restaurant-review-hogtown-smoke\/"
"Saw Star Wars episode VIII - great movie theater! Seats all were great and very comfortable - almost fell asleep because the movie was basically a repeat of the other Star Wars movie which I think hurt Solo."
"Was insulted after enjoying a meal with my wife, by the Manager.  While going to the restroom, I told The Manager that  My meal was great!  Immediately, The Manager replied O, DID YOU HAVE THE CHICKEN?\n\nBeing African-American I find this very insulting.  I felt stereotyped.  \n\nWhy would you ask Did I Have The Chicken and I am dining at a steakhouse.\n\nNext time, The Manager's reply should be WHAT DID YOU ORDER or a simple THANK YOU, GLAD YOU ENJOYED\n\nWE ONLY DINED HERE BECAUSE WE WERE HOTEL GUEST.\n\nROBERTO AND EDGAR PROVIDED US GREAT ATTENTION AND SERVICE...the manager needs to follow suit."
"4.5 - 5 STARS.\nTiny place, hidden away in the boroughs of North York.\n\nSmall and limited menu, takes forever, but everything they prepare here is authentic, and on point.  Perfect briyani, perfect kotthu rottis and their mutton rolls are to die for.  Solid Sri-Lankan little place.  Small booth, tiny kitchen.  Always meet lots of characters here who live in the area - good-natured, spirited characters and a multi-cultural mix of everyone from everywhere.  If you blink, you'll miss this place.  It is that small.  It is located next to a larger West African restaurant.  Inexpensive, but not cheaply made.  Love this place."
"I brought my daughter's Toyota Sienna there to have the car service. It was fast and reliable. The owner explained what was done and the price was very reasonable."
"I needed an older sectional cleaned and yelp steered me in the right direction. I scheduled I Clean Carpets out for Friday at 3pm and they (Alex) showed up on time. It took him 1 hour to make my sectional looking good and at a very fair price. I have no complaints and will utilize their services in the future."
"Created my own tuna and salmon custom poke bowl at this place! The portion sizes are fair for the price, but there isn't as much topping variety as other places. That said, I did like that they offered tobiko as an optional topping!\n\nI expected that since I was paying more for the dual protein (both salmon and tuna), I'd be receiving a slightly more generous amount. And so, imagine my surprise to find that only one scoop was given! Moreover, the combined salmon tuna mixture didn't look comparably ad fresh as the other plain salmon or plain tuna options. \n\nThe meal kept me decently full, but I feel that I would have been more satisfied with a bit more food. That said, the flavours were great overall (loved the pickled carrots and daikon)!"
"Our lunch with our close freind was excellent. My sister had a wood-fired Margherita pizza which was made with fresh ingredients and tasted great. My lunch was a Wagyu burger with portobello mushrooms, pancetta, Gruyere cheese, a peppadew aioli, served on a pretzel bun with a side of truffle fries. One of the top three burgers ever! Above average service in a nice setting. Would visit again."
"This is my second patio that I have used Beat the Heat for. Both have turned out amazing! The staff is great and very prompt..I feel like there are a lot of companies right now that don't stand by their scheduled time..Beat the Heat is not one of them. They scheduled me and were always on time. I recommend them to everyone!"
"I think this is a place for people who don't usually eat sushi, hence the star rating.  The slices of fish are very small, the quality is mediocre, and the atmosphere is below par.  I'd rather get  grocery store sushi than go back.  There are much better places just a few miles south.  Way overpriced for what you get."
"I have tried many nail spas in Indian Trail but I drive to Monroe. They are quick to greet you and will get you in and out quick. Everyone does a fantastic job and are very friendly no matter how busy they are."
"The food is great ... we have had it 3 days in a row.  The chicken and beef kabob is very tasteful , rice is incredible"
"This STORE IS Price gouging!! Do not go here for any reason! $5 for a Copy!! Wow! When asked why they said they were providing a service haha yeah a Rip off service. A medium box $8.99 at the UPS Store right up the street it was $3.99 And $0.99 for a copy! \n\nHorrible-Horrible-Horrible-Horrible-Horrible\nDo NOT GO HERE!"
"Went here on Canada day. This place was super packed. With the dim lighting, stained glass decors and low hanging roof and kinda maze like seating arrangements, it felt like I transported back in time to the middle ages or maybe Alladin's cave where he stored all his treasures. \n\nThe menu was ok. Decent priced, considering it includes soup or salad and ice cream. Portion was kinda small for me. Service was attentive and effecient, even though place was kinda packed."
"This place was so convenient, fast, and not at all what I was expecting. They have screens outside that you can walk up to and order and your salad is done in about 3 minutes. How awesome is that?? I got the Greek salad and honestly, that was the best dressing I've ever had. It had the feta cheese mixed into it. Also, their cucumber mint lemonade was also really good as well. Not too sweet and not too sour. The cherry on top? The salad was under $6! Go here instead of a fast food restaurant, it'll be worth it."
"Kenny's here!! First off the owner of this place has a great history of nothing but great business and great food anywhere and everywhere he is at. He is such a great person. Second of all this is exactly what Vegas needs. A more authentic Vietnamese place that has these types of dishes and the soup.. each and every soup is the best here everything here is just nothing but greatness. I've literally followed Kenny around town after each place he sells off it goes to Shit.  But it doesn't matter he's always somewhere and wherever that is that's where you must go. The food is just great here , you have to try the soup and the nem rolls."
"Let our story be a cautionary tale so you can avoid this place and its incompetence and lack of compassion.  \n\nWe brought in our 7 month old Golden Retriever puppy who has had chronic digestive issues since he came home at 8 weeks.  After diet changes, food allergy tests and numerous visits to our Western Medicine vet, we decided it was time to turn to Holistic medicine to help our little guy.  \n\nEnter, Natural Care Institute and Dr. Nancy Brandt.  We don't mind paying for quality medical care and didn't flinch at the initial consultation fee which was to provide an hour.  (It was more like 40 minutes)  Of note was that the vet never interacted with either of our dogs in a personal way.  I know she's very very busy as she kept telling us, but it was clear she wasn't invested in our session with her or our dogs.  We decided to bring a stool sample with us, which was a good thing as they would have required one.  It would seem like common sense that after having us fill out the extensive paperwork a week prior that the staff would have asked us to bring in a stool sample.  With very little information the Dr. made her diagnosis of Leaky Gut and proceeded to prescribe a bunch of medications at EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH markups.  When you can procure the same products online at 1\/10th the price I would call that GOUGING.  Knowing this we still wanted to proceed if it was going to be helpful to our puppy.  \nA few days later we received a call from the Dr.'s office saying that our dog had tested positive for Coccidia (a highly contagious parasite).  The staff member that called us couldn't even pronounce it properly, much less inform us of the dangers this parasite could cause to our pup and all other dogs he came in contact with.  We repeatedly asked to talk with the Dr., but of course she was too busy.  We checked with other vets, dog trainers, and canine experts who all were shocked that they didn't tell us to quarantine our dogs, sterilize all areas they had been in, etc.  All they could do was tell us to come down and pick up some Alban medication, but the staff couldn't answer any of our questions.  \n\nFast forward a few days...Some friends who had invited us to a puppy pool party had four dogs, (all of whom had direct contact with ours) and some started to exhibit disturbing symptoms and one had to be be hospitalized with severe vomiting, diarrhea, lack of appetite and lethargy.  Diagnosis:  Coccidia.  Then, our other dog started to exhibit symptoms.  When I called Dr. Brandt to ask what to do I was informed that she would be unavailable that day and that they could not tell me what day I could expect a return call.  Coccidia, if not treated quickly, can be a very serious condition.  Needless to say, I was appalled that this so called veterinarian cared so very little for the well being of their own patients.  \n\nThe bottom line is that all of this could have been avoided if the vet had been competent and had properly advised us.  Clearly this Dr is only in business for the sole purpose of making money and obviously doesn't care about the health and wellbeing of our precious pets.  \n\nAVOID AVOID AVOID"
"So happy a great coffee joint opened in the west valley!!!!! Came to study for my nclex exam! Great quiet atmosphere, bright, with plenty of seating! The only downside is the location of outlets in relation to the amount of tables. Great study spot with delicious coffee!!"
"Went to have my thyroid checked up - they said I need my blood sugar tested as well and assured me all coverage would be covered by my insurance. They kept me in the office for about 3 hours, then told me I needed to have a blood sugar monitor attached to my arm for a week to keep tabs of the levels. All this time was spent with the PA, Leanna Peterson.\nThe Dr. came in for about 2 minutes at that appointment.\nI then had to come back about a week later to get the monitor removed from my arm - another 3 hours in the office. They wanted more follow ups, but by this time I figured out that the office appears to be more interests in tests to generate bills that are NOT covered by insurance.\nI ended up with bills topping $600 and paid them as I did not want my credit to be ruined by this office - beware!!"
"I have been wanting to try this place and it did not disappoint. I ordered a margherita and a pepperoni to go. When I called they were going to be so quick that I actually asked them to push it back. It smelled heavenly inside. Pizzas were amazing, slight char and great taste. Definitely recommend it!"
"Cuteology Cakes created a cake for my Father on Father's Day! It was not only delicious but looked better than I could ever imagine! My Dad was SO impressed & I look forward to having Alyssa create more cakes for every special occasion!"
"Great food aside, I really want to make a shout out to everyone working today at around 1:00 pm because if someone who works all day on their feet runs out to stop you in your car before you leave the parking lot just to give you the fries you forgot, they really need some credit for that. That was just amazing, over and beyond service! Especially when I could tell everyone was already stretched thin trying to take care of their very busy lobby, among other things. Thank you everyone! You're awesome!"
"Parking is ok now that baseball is over. But the place is suddenly filthy. There was a change in management in the last two months that not been positive. The one thing this place has going for it was the nice people who worked at this location. I only recognize one person (and he's still nice) but everyone else is new.  Pictures of the dirty machines are attached. Hair, dust, sweat accumulating for weeks. Lifetime can't open soon enough!"
"The service is quick, the food is very good, and the prices are very reasonable. I definitely recommend this place."
"Great for a quick stop for a pre-made slice of pizza, New York-style.  You choose your toppings, they fix up your slice or slices and then reheat until it is hot.  If you only like fresh, out-of-the-oven, burn-the-roof-of-your-mouth pizza, this is not your place. You can get fresh out of the oven whole pizzas that are quite tasty.  We eat here a lot because the 2 of us don't need a whole pizza and my husband will not eat leftover pizza the next day.  Combos are reasonably priced for a slice or 2 with salad or wings and a drink\n\nLunch is thier busiest time at this location. Sometimes the service is spotty and they always seem to be training a new employee on the register during the busier times in the evening. Once you get your order in properly, you can expect it to come out in a short amount of time. We had dreadful service one night and the manager called us personally and gave us a credit on the register to come back and eat.  Props to him!"
"As soon as we got there we got amazing service! Staff was super nice and everyone looked like they were happy to be there which is unusual to see with some restaurants.  My husband and I ordered the brisket plate and had the option to do it moist or dry and we both chose moist.  The plate automatically comes with cornbread which isn't the best thing I've ever had.  The cornbread was different by having actually pieces of corn inside but it was so dry.  You can definitely taste the smoked flavor in the brisket but it was a bit bland so you can add whatever BBQ sauce you'd please.  I loved the KC sauce because it had nice spicy kick to it.  I didn't care much for the other 5 sauces but that is my own preference.  I honestly don't think the pricing was too bad compared to what I would usually spend on a BBQ dinner down south.  Will definitely try this place again to see how consistent their food is since they just opened recently."
"We've been here b4 with no major problems but today was horrible! Everywhere had a wait this morning.. Now i know why Fran's didnt. Hardly anyone there yet we waited almost 15 minutes to have our order taken.. From that point on nothing but bad service the waitress acting so busy hardly doing anything and once the food finally arrived it was a total mess and just completely tasteless? Mess up bacon n eggs really???? Won't b back here.. Next time we'll b waiting somewhere for great food! Sorry Fran your employees aren't doing a good job for your business at all."
"Best sushi place I've ever tasted...My favorite roll is the shrimp tempura roll and I love the Mizo soup"
"I have been coming here for years and this place is great. No, they did not try and rip me off on numerous occasions. For example, my heat pan was falling and while they could have said I needed another or charge me for other things it cost me $20 to remove it. On another occasion I wanted my anti-theft removed because it was causing problems with starting the car but the company was out of business so they tried for hours and contacted other companies because it was difficult to find - they charged me nothing because they did not fix the problem! It was later discovered and removed while doing a scheduled maintenance. Moreover, I used to take my car to a dealer and it would cost me over $200 every time. I moved to Verdun and it cost me $89 - WOW, now that is a surprise!!"
"I think this owner and the owner of Amy's Baking Company are soul mates. That is all..."
"Off the grid Mexican in Vegas. Very tasty, quality food and fantastic margaritas. Staff were very friendly as well. This place will be a regular stop for me when In Vegas going forward."
"We hired Taco Naco to cater our family party after my daughter's baptism.  Another caterer backed out last minute, and we only had a couple of days' notice. Victor was very nice and got back to us very quickly. His quote was competitive, but it also included additional items that other taco vendors did not (like grilled veggies, which were excellent). We were running a little late from the baptism, but Victor was patient and waited an extra 20 minutes for us. \n\nThe food was excellent! The chicken, steak and pork were all very tasty. The guacamole was fresh and not from paste. We ordered a lot of food and had leftovers, but the guac was completely gone. I should have ordered double! :) \n\nHighly recommended."
"Having just come back from Hawaii a few months ago, I was craving for Hawaiian pancakes and decided to go to this Las Vegas location.\n\nYou definitely get the island vibes here, nice warm smiles from the workers and simple Hawaiian decor indoor.\n\nI ordered the loco moco and as a surprise they offered a free stack of their guava chiffon pancake.\n\n**PROs:  definitely great for the pancakes, the portions are pretty big and filling.  \n\n**CONs:  the loco moco was not so flavorful, and a bit bland.  Same with the macaroni salad, a little on the bland side, and I am not much of a salty food eater. Even if you do add salt on the side, it was not flavorful as I hoped. Nothing comparable to Hawaii's loco moco.  I don't recommend it. \n\nNonetheless, I might come back some time to try their other pancake flavors!"
