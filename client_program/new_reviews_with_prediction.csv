Terrible experience!!!!!!!!!!! I hired them to pack my four bedroom home the day before the moving trucks were to arrive to move me. When I arrived home in the evening to inspect the packing I found less then half the house packed. I took photos and sent them to head office asking for a refund and an explanation. I was up until 3 am packing my house and I am now still waiting a month to hear from them regarding what they will do for me. They took the payment on my visa and I have had no refund for a job NOT DONE!! Terrible company shame on them! *the franchise owner is also an owner of 1-800-GOT-JUNK.,1,1.0,0.0,0.0
"A hidden gem in a very quiet plaza. The good food, service and potion size warrants a solid 4 stars. I would definitely come back again to try more dishes. \n\nFood:\nOrdered the khinkali (georgian dumplings) with pork and beef which were large dumplings with juicy well seasoned fillings. The dumpling skin was thin with a generous sized filling that gave it a nice texture. Perfect appetizer to start. \n\nCrepes sulliko was a great choice as well. I liked it plain without the sauce so that I could fully appreciate the ground beef filling. Crepes was wrapped like a large spring roll. \n\nLamb shish kabob was delicious. The mashed potato side dish complimented it well. The creamy mash paired with the very meaty lamb kabob was a great combo. I ordered medium for kabob and it came to perfection. Tender and delicious. Don't get fooled that it's 1 kabob, portions are generous. The naan that came with it was fluffy and soft. \n\nService:\nAlthough busy, the food came out quickly and they were attentive. However, I would have liked it more if they would provide refills of water, sauce and sharp knives with the kabobs without us asking all the time.",5,0.0,0.0333,0.9667

"I was shocked and truly hurt today by Earnhardt Chrysler. I pulled up to look at used cars today.

It's a great mall in a old tradition of the West of uncovered malls. The town square has a variety of high-end stores almost any that you could want for really any age group.

"A friend had heard amazing things about Hogtown Smoke and I had never really been to a real smokehouse before so we decided to check it out. I heard one of the big reasons to go to this place is so you can hang out on the patio. Sadly I go deaf when there is a lot of traffic outside. This restaurant is in The Beaches so we decided to stay inside where it was definitely very, very quiet.\n\nThe menu was very well organized but there was a little problem... The prices were a tad high! I know the food is cooked longer which must be more expensive but this made me have pretty high expectations for the quality of food. In other words, it had better taste as good as they are charging. \n\nThe fried pickles were pretty good. I liked that they were deep fried in a cornmeal crust. It gave them some additional crunch and bite. The dipping sauce was also quite good. Then our meat meal came. Chicken wings and burnt butts, apparently their specialty. Everyone loves them. \n\nThe restaurant had its own plethora of BBQ sauces to choose from for the wings. I did not like any of them. The odds of that are very low. I always need a sauce. I kept trying and trying but they all tasted kind of... funky.\n\nSpeaking of which, those burnt butts were all kinds of wrong. Just because you cook something for a long time does not make it more delicious. I have no issues with slightly carcinogenic blackened meat but this was pretty awful. Dry, off tasting, off putting... And not cheap!\n\nI could live with the not-greatness of the meal but the worst part was using the washroom down the break-neck-steep staircase in the basement. Hygienically, it is the worst washroom I have ever been to at a restaurant. It stank like a hogtown (maybe THAT is where it gets its name) and the sink did not work. It made me sick to my stomach and I wanted to get the hell out of there.\n\nI will say that the service was very pleasant and we were not rushed out of there at all. Considering the lack of people in the restaurant though... The only reason why I am giving this restaurant any wooden spoon is because of the service and the deep fried pickles. The people were nice but I am sorry, for that price the quality and flavour of the food were terrible and the pigsty in the basement unforgivable. I will not be back and have actually warned family and friends to stay away.\n\nI give this foodie experience one of out five wooden spoons.

Perfect briyani, perfect kotthu rottis and their mutton rolls are to die for.  Solid Sri-Lankan little place.  Small booth, tiny kitchen.  Always meet lots of characters here who live in the area - good-natured, spirited characters and a multi-cultural mix of everyone from everywhere.  If you blink, you'll miss this place.

"Created my own tuna and salmon custom poke bowl at this place! The portion sizes are fair for the price, but there isn't as much topping variety as other places. That said, I did like that they offered tobiko as an optional topping!\n\nI expected that since I was paying more for the dual protein (both salmon and tuna), I'd be receiving a slightly more generous amount. And so, imagine my surprise to find that only one scoop was given! Moreover, the combined salmon tuna mixture didn't look comparably ad fresh as the other plain salmon or plain tuna options. \n\nThe meal kept me decently full, but I feel that I would have been more satisfied with a bit more food. That said, the flavours were great overall (loved the pickled carrots and daikon)!",3,0.0,0.9988,0.0012

"Let our story be a cautionary tale so you can avoid this place and its incompetence and lack of compassion.  \n\nWe brought in our 7 month old Golden Retriever puppy who has had chronic digestive issues since he came home at 8 weeks.  After diet changes, food allergy tests and numerous visits to our Western Medicine vet, we decided it was time to turn to Holistic medicine to help our little guy.  \n\nEnter, Natural Care Institute and Dr. Nancy Brandt.  We don't mind paying for quality medical care and didn't flinch at the initial consultation fee which was to provide an hour.  (It was more like 40 minutes)  Of note was that the vet never interacted with either of our dogs in a personal way.  I know she's very very busy as she kept telling us, but it was clear she wasn't invested in our session with her or our dogs.  We decided to bring a stool sample with us, which was a good thing as they would have required one.  It would seem like common sense that after having us fill out the extensive paperwork a week prior that the staff would have asked us to bring in a stool sample.  With very little information the Dr. made her diagnosis of Leaky Gut and proceeded to prescribe a bunch of medications at EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH markups.  When you can procure the same products online at 1\/10th the price I would call that GOUGING.  Knowing this we still wanted to proceed if it was going to be helpful to our puppy.  \nA few days later we received a call from the Dr.'s office saying that our dog had tested positive for Coccidia (a highly contagious parasite).  The staff member that called us couldn't even pronounce it properly, much less inform us of the dangers this parasite could cause to our pup and all other dogs he came in contact with.  We repeatedly asked to talk with the Dr., but of course she was too busy.  We checked with other vets, dog trainers, and canine experts who all were shocked that they didn't tell us to quarantine our dogs, sterilize all areas they had been in, etc.  All they could do was tell us to come down and pick up some Alban medication, but the staff couldn't answer any of our questions.  \n\nFast forward a few days...Some friends who had invited us to a puppy pool party had four dogs, (all of whom had direct contact with ours) and some started to exhibit disturbing symptoms and one had to be be hospitalized with severe vomiting, diarrhea, lack of appetite and lethargy.  Diagnosis:  Coccidia.  Then, our other dog started to exhibit symptoms.  When I called Dr. Brandt to ask what to do I was informed that she would be unavailable that day and that they could not tell me what day I could expect a return call.  Coccidia, if not treated quickly, can be a very serious condition.  Needless to say, I was appalled that this so called veterinarian cared so very little for the well being of their own patients.  \n\nThe bottom line is that all of this could have been avoided if the vet had been competent and had properly advised us.  Clearly this Dr is only in business for the sole purpose of making money and obviously doesn't care about the health and wellbeing of our precious pets.  \n\nAVOID AVOID AVOID",1,1.0,0.0,0.0

"Great for a quick stop for a pre-made slice of pizza, New York-style.  You choose your toppings, they fix up your slice or slices and then reheat until it is hot.  If you only like fresh, out-of-the-oven, burn-the-roof-of-your-mouth pizza, this is not your place. You can get fresh out of the oven whole pizzas that are quite tasty.  We eat here a lot because the 2 of us don't need a whole pizza and my husband will not eat leftover pizza the next day.  Combos are reasonably priced for a slice or 2 with salad or wings and a drink\n\nLunch is thier busiest time at this location.

As soon as we got there we got amazing service! Staff was super nice and everyone looked like they were happy to be there which is unusual to see with some restaurants.  My husband and I ordered the brisket plate and had the option to do it moist or dry and we both chose moist.  The plate automatically comes with cornbread which isn't the best thing I've ever had.  The cornbread was different by having actually pieces of corn inside but it was so dry.  You can definitely taste the smoked flavor in the brisket but it was a bit bland so you can add whatever BBQ sauce you'd please.  I loved the KC sauce because it had nice spicy kick to it.  I didn't care much for the other 5 sauces but that is my own preference.  I honestly don't think the pricing was too bad compared to what I would usually spend on a BBQ dinner down south.  Will definitely try this place again to see how consistent their food is since they just opened recently.,5,0.0,0.0004,0.9996
